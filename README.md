We at [TinyProgrammers](http://TinyProgrammers.ga) were copying pasting the same code in multiple projects again and again and again over the time this makes it complex to update every project we maintain to latest version of widgets.

So we created [TinyWidgets](/). this Lib/Package contains all of our most common used Widgets with flexible parameters that you will love to work with.

Okay we shouldn't talk much and let our work impress you!
